# Setup

1. Install node and npm
2. Install project dependencies `npm -i`
3. Run app `npm start`







# Would be Nice...

- Redux - Ended up putting everything in single view because of not having to bind this, pass state via props, or deal with other bits that would be easier with Redux
- styled-components instead of css
- Routing for different views
- Put request util in Redux action
- Build proper error handling
- Build proper loading mechanism
- Display more than one item if equal or close to equal in terms of number of times seen



# Went Well



# Was Difficult

- I can definitely understand the usefulness of Redux
