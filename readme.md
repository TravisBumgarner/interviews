# Setup

1. Install node and npm
2. Install project dependencies `npm -i`
3. Run app `npm start`

# Would be Nice...

- Redux - Ended up putting everything in single view because of not wanting to deal with things like `bind(this)`, pass state via props, or deal with other bits that would be easier with Redux
- Routing for different views
- Put request util in Redux action
- Build proper error handling instead of alerts
- Build proper loading display
- Display more than one item if equal or close to equal in terms of number of times seen

# Went Well

- Setup was a breeze, I tried out react-create-app and it's super simple


# Was Difficult

- I can definitely understand the usefulness of Redux
