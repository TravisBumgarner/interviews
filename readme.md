# Future Development

Some thoughts about functionality and potential improvements.

## UI

- Could definitely use some more whitespace between buttons

## Requests

- Admin currently doesn't work unless a request has been made via the home page. It would be better to setup so that some questions are loaded by default with pagination.

## Pagination

- Keep track of unanswered questions and when the number of remaining questions is less than 2, request more questions.
