# Setup

1. Install node and npm
2. Install project dependencies `npm -i`

# Would be Nice...

- Redux
- styled-components instead of css
- Routing for different views
- Put request util in Redux action
- Build proper error handling



# Went Well



# Was Difficult

- I can definitely understand the usefulness of Redux
